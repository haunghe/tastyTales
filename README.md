# About IOBC
 This year you will be working on an international team project. This means that every team has to complete a project, and 
that every team is international. This is not an “international competition” (France vs. Bulgaria …), this is a competition 
between international teams.
 Every team is composed of a balanced number of students with different skills (programming, graphic design, digital 
communication, audiovisual production) so that the workload may be fairly shared. And every team is composed of students 
from at least 3 different countries
